# Metal-to-piano execution result — 7 September 2026

**VERIFIED_NO_RELEASE_CANDIDATE. Strong musical certification: pending.**

The authorized no-release branch is the result. The engineering is reviewable and tested, but the system has not demonstrated reliable automatic metal-to-piano music. Zero of the six required qualifying full-song imports were achieved. No beta route, source index, model, catalog migration or production deployment was enabled. PR [#82](https://github.com/Reedtrullz/Keyspilli/pull/82) stays unmerged because merging main invokes deployment.

## Implemented behavior

- Preserved coherent low melody phrases before hand assignment, removed short harmonic clones from shared melody/rhythm/harmony evidence, and truncated same-key sustains at cross-source retriggers. Paired low-theme/high-lead regressions protect against merely preferring low notes. The three permitted selector iterations are exhausted.
- Added a disabled native MIDI route: requested recording ID → operator-verified source index → bounded DNS-checked acquisition → pinned hash/terms verification → native-time normalization → existing frozen symbolic builder → five public levels. This is automatic indexed resolution, not general internet discovery. No MusicXML acquisition or tutorial layout is advertised by this route.
- Added source/arrangement/timing/melody/license provenance to saved artifacts and both player views. A caller cannot disable the built-in reference-hash boundary. No answer-key notes enter generation.
- Added renewable owned job leases, stale-owner/cancellation rejection, validated duplicate reuse and distinct IDs for changed source bytes. Separator failures now return review rather than silently publishing full-mix fallback. Invalid or unsupported beta inputs receive explicit review/error outcomes.
- Integrated current main's Cathedral player. Real PlaybackEngine-to-Cathedral tests check positive RH/LH gain and scheduling; actual browser controls were exercised with Piano background / Organ / Cathedral. This is not a claim of hardware listening acceptance.

## Evidence and failed gates

| Requirement | Result and boundary |
|---|---|
| Six new full-song cases | **0/6 required**, no source family qualified. Six researched leads were paid or had unverified production rights; synthetic fixtures are excluded. This is bounded research, not proof that eligible sources cannot exist. |
| Independent real references | **0/6 inspected targets** yielded complete eligible aligned pairs. Direct audio cannot be promoted. |
| Three clean piano controls | Baseline precision 0.8453 / 0.7430 / 0.6903. Strict piano challenger precision 0.982456 / 0.987342 / 0.887681; recall 0.989399 / 0.975 / 0.98. Debussy fails fixed precision ≥0.95. These are rendered-control results, not metal accuracy. |
| Monophonic challenger | Invented upper line 16/16; bass timing 0/16. Two configurations exhausted. Polyphonic use not attempted. |
| Melody preservation | Both invented identity cases 16/16 with no unmatched identity attacks; all-level lineage and physical-key overlap regressions pass. No synthetic-to-real quality inference. |
| Cached development replay | **12/12 structural passes**, all five public levels. Silent Lucidity sounding overlap reduced 9→7. Source-note correctness, repeats/transitions/form and human musical acceptance remain unqualified. |
| Actual API exports | **5/5 levels**: player notes versus downloaded MIDI and MusicXML pass semantic validation. Isolated synthetic fixture, actual HTTP handlers; not a successful real-song import. |
| Worker safety | **14/14 controlled failure categories**, 60 service tests. Real worker/parser/DB/publication with injected transport/disk/separator faults. Lease restart/reclaim uses fake clock; no production restart claim. |
| Player/UI | 120 player-core tests; 23 focused source/API/error tests. Browser full and direct-sheet views show beta, melody status, selected source, requested recording and arrangement timing. |
| CI | [Run 34153439558](https://github.com/Reedtrullz/Keyspilli/actions/runs/34153439558) passes at code commit `104d156edb595804589e52f0797669d6902b03f9`, including **42/42 Playwright**. Final documentation commit's exact-head check is retained on PR82 and checked before handoff. |
| Holdouts | **20 supported + 6 challenge untouched**, no predictions in runs/replay output roots. All 38 original audio SHA256s still match the frozen source manifest. |
| Release/canary | Not run: mandatory source/music gate failed. No merge, build/push of release images, backup/rollback execution or production mutations. Existing deployment workflow is unchanged. |

Local CI used the exact workflow commands in the disposable `metal-ci` checkout. Installation, fetch-seed, pipeline, catalog verification, chord verification, calibration, typechecks, unit tests, build, Chromium installation/runtime and access-boundary checks all exited 0. Seed fetching reported two download failures but the existing command exited 0; the resulting pipeline processed 110 bases / 660 rows with zero pipeline failures. This does not establish completeness of every remote seed.

Failures are retained: first local browser run 30 passed / 3 failed / 9 not run under cold dev-server load; production-server retry 38 passed / 1 failed / 3 not run because a prior test upload remained in the disposable catalog; clean-catalog retry 42/42 passed. First GitHub run at80195e1 had 41 passed / 1 hydration-sensitive assertion failure; retrying the same expected class assertion fixed it at104d156. No timeout or musical threshold was relaxed. Logs remain private; first-run traces were overwritten, second-run failed artifacts remain.

## Requirement-by-requirement completion

1. **Task1 complete:** bounded maintained runner, source/code/config hashes, held-out rejection, cache invalidation and runnable private inputs.
2. **Task2 complete by authorized no-promotion branch:** six targets exhausted, three clean controls, fixed independent policy and explicit coverage gap.
3. **Task3 complete by no-promotion branch:** two challengers × two configurations; precise failed gates, no production adapters added. MuScriptor's noncommercial weights excluded. Piano specialist code declaration MIT / weights CC-BY4 verified and recorded, but it did not qualify.
4. **Task4 complete:** root-cause identity/sustain fixes, paired regressions and twelve cached replays. Real musical quality remains unproven.
5. **Task5 implementation complete; release exit FAILED:** indexed native resolution and honest provenance work in actual worker fixtures. Zero eligible real production entries; unsupported tutorial/piano/direct-audio routes remain excluded. Failure is carried into the explicitly authorized no-release endpoint, not relabelled a full-song success.
6. **Task6 complete:** owned leases, recovery/cancellation/idempotency/source-version/failure matrix, UI and player checks.
7. **Task7 complete for no-release scope:** exact checks, five-level API export comparisons, frozen scorecard/hashes and review bundle. Six qualifying songs and complete musical form cannot be certified; those are the failed release gates.
8. **Task8 no-release branch:** scoped diff, PR82 and exact-head CI. No eligible route means no canary/merge/deploy. Production image retained. No rollback needed or claimed.

## Preservation

Read-only snapshots at **18:49:05 UTC** and **19:01:09 UTC** match: 2,688 rows, 448 bases, 272 plays and 8,998 artifact files. Full rows SHA256 `72b6ce6c298cea4eac70cc1e3a783b482d094f1c96a779ecd5d9195e4fb4957f`; artifact inventory `944a32541f023a70d2c6c4bc45f8afa260ea63915fbbfcee45da0d65d7b6f1b3`. Approved Livgardet and ABBA artifact hashes also match; exact values are in the acceptance JSON.

These snapshots cover the final verification interval, not the whole goal. The starting production image and absence of production mutation are separate evidence; no missing initial artifact snapshot is fabricated. Production stays at `c36680100de9`, worker digest `sha256:867c6f9908926a49576d4cc1bed2150e67897e8a848a7fa7cca63a7cf3943ab2`. The original `/Users/reidar/Projectos/Keyspilli` WIP remains outside this branch. All catalog rebuilding was isolated in `metal-ci`.

## Runnable review and evidence

Open [the local review page](http://127.0.0.1:8874/final-review/index.html). File: `/Users/reidar/Projectos/.keyspilli-worktrees/metal-delivery/output/metal-development/final-review/index.html`. Twelve revised experimental arrangements each include original audio, selected identity and five piano levels (72 previews). MIDI hashes, file existence and audio durations were checked. Browser playback, feedback persistence and JSON export passed. An automated feedback probe was cleared; no human feedback was invented. The page's only missing asset is an unused favicon.

The rejected old A/B page remains privately preserved at `output/metal-development/listening.html`; it is not presented for another approval. New previews reflect the identity/sustain fixes but remain optional diagnostics, not music awaiting routine sign-off. Listening cannot override missing objective/source gates.

From the worktree, replay without fresh inference:

```sh
export PATH=/Users/reidar/.nvm/versions/node/v22.22.3/bin:$PATH
node --import tsx packages/catalog/scripts/run-metal-development.ts \
  --manifest docs/research/keyspilli-evidence/metal-delivery-cohort-2026-09-07.json \
  --hashes docs/research/keyspilli-evidence/metal-delivery-source-freeze-2026-09-07.json \
  --recordings output/metal-development/recordings \
  --cached-stems output/metal-development/runs \
  --output output/metal-development/replay-current
```

Require at least30GiB free before running this bounded replay; it uses cached MIDI and never publishes. Fresh inference subprocesses additionally enforce the runner disk guard. Historical exact code/config/source/artifact identities are in each frozen replay `complete.json` and the acceptance report. Network-only code changed after the merged replay; the review renderer recomputed canonical MIDI and required a hash match. Do not relabel a newly generated code hash as the historical run.

Important tracked reports in this directory: `metal-beta-acceptance-2026-09-07.json` (per-song results, exact commands, API outputs, preservation and private artifact hashes), `metal-upstream-comparison-2026-09-07.json`, `metal-recovery-reference-manifest-2026-09-07.json`, `metal-source-route-decision-2026-09-07.json`, `metal-worker-safety-2026-09-07.json`, and `metal-identity-preservation-2026-09-07.json`. Private media/reference notes are not committed. Private experiment/render/API scripts remain runnable and SHA-bound in acceptance evidence; independent reference notes remain outside the repository.

## Actual remaining work

The original “just works” product goal remains unmet. A future release needs eligible same-song sources and six qualifying complete automatic imports, or a genuinely improved transcription/tutorial route with independent reference evidence. Current tuning/setup budgets are exhausted. Strong musical certification additionally needs the untouched holdout cohort and human full-song/five-level assessment; none was consumed or claimed here. The authorized execution reaches its no-release terminal state without pretending that engineering hardening solved transcription.
